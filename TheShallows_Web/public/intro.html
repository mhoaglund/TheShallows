            <p class="en">The Shallows is an experimental interactive installation meant to elaborate on existing ways of managing collections of objects. The installation includes a curated set of found and made objects, along with a set of controls and interfaces that allow visitors to intervene in the way the set of objects is arranged. <br/>Visitors engage with the installation by collaborating with one another to author changes to it, and in the process their involvement is added to the history of the work.
                A visitor may choose the way they interact with the work- they might physically rearrange the array according to a set of instructions created by another visitor, or they might use a digital interface to sketch out a new arrangement for another visitor to enact later. In both cases, their efforts are documented visually in a ledger which shows the history of all the interactions that have occurred within the work.<br/>
                The function of this work revolves around a troublesome collision between two things: deep cultural memory as it is infused into material, and short term adaptive behavior as it arises from the technologies and politics of the moment. The work attempts to posit answers about how to deal with the permanent and material as interpretive data proliferates and the identity of objects is increasingly informed by an overloaded, ongoing, transactional narrative.
